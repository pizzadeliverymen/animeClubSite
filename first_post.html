            <h3>It's been almost a week since i did this</h3>
            <p>
                I am continuing my journey of re-learning how to dev a web by re-reading all of the lessons and stuff, this one is on css so things might look a bit different.
                What I had before was this:
                <div class="code">
                    <pre>&lt;style&gt;
    body:
    {
        background-color: hotpink;
    }
&lt;&sol;style&gt;</pre>
                </div>  What do you mean there's basically nothing there? I'll have you know I spent a whole 30 seconds agonizing about what to have as my style last week!
                But yeah, no font, no alignment, no adjustments for highlighted text, nothing.  It was even an internal stylesheet instead of a seperate file, which im sure is 
                great for generalizing a webpage.
                <span class="highlight">maybe someday i can be one of those fansypants who makes a game using js and puts it on a website.</span> see what i did there?
                i applied what i learnt, and thus i am making it easier to rember.  At least, thats what I've always heard works, ive never actually researched if its true.<br>
                Also, I changed the color of the website! The text is a tetradic color to the hot-pink background I use. (i like hot-pink and so I will always use it).
            </p>
            <p>
                What else is there to do? Oh yeah! I know <ruby>Japanese<rp>(</rp><rt>日本語</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>. or should i put 
                <ruby>日本語<rp>(</rp><rt>Japanese</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.  Or maybe use it like its supposed to be used
                <ruby>日本語<rp>(</rp><rt>にほんご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>. The 
                <span class="code"><ruby>&lt;ruby&gt;<rp>(</rp><rt>roo-bee</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></span> element is the best element.
            </p>
